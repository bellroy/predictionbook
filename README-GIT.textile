h1. Prediction Book

There are two prediction-book repositories to

* Allow engaged prediction-book users to contribute changes (predictionbook-public)
* Allow us to keep prediction-book deployment / setup information safe (predictionbook-private)

h2. Public repository

All functional changes should (must) be done on this repository. Contributors make pull requests to this repository.

git@github.com:tricycle/predictionbook-public.git

h2. Private repository

All changes made to the public repository need to be pulled into this repository.

This repository contains additional deployment and setup information (that cannot go into the secrets repo), all other sources should be in-sync.

Changes to this repository must not be pushed to the public repository.

git@git.trikeapps.com:predictionbook.git

h3. Configure private repository with remote public repository

Within the local clone of the private repository, add the public repository as a new remote:

git remote add public git@github.com:tricycle/predictionbook-public.git

In order to NOT push changes from the private to the public repository, cripple the push url:

git remote set-url --push public no-pushing

h3. Pull changes from the public repository

Fetch changes from public repository

git fetch public

Merge changes from public repository

git merge public/master --no-ff

Push changes to private remote repository

git push origin master
