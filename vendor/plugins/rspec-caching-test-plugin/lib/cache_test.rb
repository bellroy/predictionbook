  # = Rspec caching test plugin
  # 
  # This plugin helps you test your caching with rspec. It provides you with
  # matchers to test if caching and expiring does what you want it to do.
  # 
  # This is basic but useful stuff, extracted from one of my projects. Here's
  # all the matches you'll get:
  # 
  # * <tt>cache_page(url)</tt>
  # * <tt>expire_page(url)</tt>
  # * <tt>cache_action(action)</tt>
  # * <tt>cache_fragment(name)</tt>
  # * <tt>expire_action(action)</tt>
  # * <tt>expire_fragment(name)</tt>
  # 
  # Note that +cache_action+ and +cache_fragment+ are the same thing, only
  # +cache_action+ turns your +action+ argument into the right +name+ using
  # +fragment_cache_key+.
  #
  # == Installation
  #
  # This is almost a drop-in solution. You only need to set up this plugin's
  # test hooks by calling its +setup+ method, preferably in your
  # <tt>spec_helper.rb</tt> file like so:
  #
  #   AGW::CacheTest.setup
  #
  # == Example
  # 
  # Consider the following example specification:
  # 
  #   describe PostsController do
  #     describe "handling GET /posts" do
  #       it "should cache the page" do
  #         lambda { get :index }.should cache_page('/posts')
  #       end
  #   
  #       it "should cache the RSS feed" do
  #         lambda { 
  #           get :index, :format => 'rss' 
  #         }.should cache_page('/posts.rss')
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # The +cache_page+ matcher tests if your lambda actually triggers the 
  # caching.
  # 
  #   describe "handling GET /users/1" do
  #     it "should cache the action" do
  #       lambda { 
  #         get :show, :id => 1, :user_id => @user.id 
  #       }.should cache_action(:show)
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # The +cache_action+ takes a symbol for the action of the current controller
  # to test for, or an entire Hash to be used with +url_for+.

  module CacheTest
    
    # Call this method to set up this caching mechanism in your code.
    # Ideally this would go into your +spec_helper.rb+.
    #
    # This method enables caching and hooks into the fragment and page
    # caching systems to let all caching flow through this plugin. It also
    # enables the rspec matchers.
    #
    # This method must be called to activate the plugin:
    #
    #   AGW::CacheTest.setup
    # 
    #--
    # TODO: somehow drop this in init.rb
    def self.setup
      # Turn on caching
      ActionController::Base.perform_caching = true

      # Hook into the fragment and page caching mechanisms
      ActionController::Base.cache_store = AGW::CacheTest::TestStore.new
      ActionController::Base.class_eval do
        include AGW::CacheTest::PageCaching
      end
      
      # Make our matchers available to rspec via Test::Unit
      RSpec::Matchers.class_eval do
        include Matchers
      end
    end
    
    # This class is the cache store used during testing. All fragment caching
    # requests come to here. It tells us what was cached and what was
    # expired by the application.
    #
    # == Usage
    #
    # The application uses this class in its caching. In tests we can
    # ask the class about this as follows:
    #
    #   @test_store = TestStore.new
    #   ...trigger caching...
    #   @test_store.cached?('my_page') # => true
    #   @test_store.expired?('my_page') # => false
    #   ...trigger expiration...
    #   @test_store.expired?('my_page') # => true
    # 
    # == Perform the actual caching
    #
    # This test cache store can actually cache content, but by default
    # does not. If it caches and returns cached content this might affect
    # your tests, forcing you to reset the cache for every test so as to
    # get the desired behaviour.
    #
    # The default behaviour is set on creation of the TestStore by
    # passing in a simple flag. You can, however, change this at run time
    # like so:
    #
    #   @a = TestStore.new       # => caching is off
    #   @a.read_cache = true     # => caching is on
    #   
    #   @b = TestStore.new(true) # => caching is on
    #   @b.read_cache = false    # => caching is off
    #
    # When needed the cache can be cleared manually like so:
    #
    #   ActionController::Base.cache_store.reset
    # 
    class TestStore < ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

      # Record of what the app tells us to cache
      attr_reader :cached
      
      # Record of what the app tells us to expire
      attr_reader :expired
      
      # Record of what the app tells us to expire via patterns
      attr_reader :expiration_patterns
      
      # Cached data that could be returned
      attr_reader :data
      
      # Setting to enable the returning of cached data.
