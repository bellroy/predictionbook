# Roles

This is an example of a roles file. Use this example as reference to customize
your YAML files.

    admin:
      Entry: create, read, update, delete
      Category: create, read, update, delete
      AdminUser: all

    editor:
      Entry: create, read, update
      Category: read, update

You can also define `resources` which are not related to a model, for example
to control `Redis`.

    admin:
      Redis: index, flush_all
