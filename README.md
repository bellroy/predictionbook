PredictionBook
==============
![Build Status](https://github.com/bellroy/predictionbook/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

[PredictionBook](http://predictionbook.com/) is a site to record and
track your predictions.

## How sure are you?

Rather than just recording what you think will happen, PredictionBook
allows you to record just how sure you are that it will happen. You can
distinguish between those things you think will probably occur, and
those things you're really really sure will occur. If you're properly
calibrated, you'll be able to see that about 60% of the things you're
60% sure will happen, do happen, and 90% of the things you're 90% sure
will happen, do happen.

## History

PredictionBook was originally written by
[TrikeApps](http://trikeapps.com/), the geeking arm of the [Investling
Group](http://investling.com/), which then merged into its sister company
[Bellroy](https://bellroy.com). PredictionBook is now an open source project
[hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/bellroy/predictionbook).
